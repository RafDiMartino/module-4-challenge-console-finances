# Console Finances - challenge

## Description
In this assignement I was given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to create a financial analysis tool by writing JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/Number of months)

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The results of the analysis is displayed on the browser console and as an additional task I have displayed the results also on the web page
